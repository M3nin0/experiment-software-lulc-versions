# rep-lulc-versions

A test to verify the impact caused by different software versions on the classification of land use and land cover maps using [SITS R Package](https://github.com/e-sensing/sits) and [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)

> These tests were done as a practical way to understand that versions matter. Software is always evolving, so it makes no sense to assume that different versions produce the same results!
